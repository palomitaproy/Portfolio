            | I create high performance & rich interactive websites that work across all platforms & devices.
            | Although I'm very familiar with using frameworks like: 
            span
              | React.js 
            | my websites are primarily hand-coded using: 
            span
              |HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript.
            | With a strong emphasis on "Progressive Enhancement", I look for creative ways to push the boundaries of website front-end code without compromising on browser support and performance.
