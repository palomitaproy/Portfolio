      h2 I’m a front-end web developer based in Berlin.

        | I create high performance & rich interactive websites that work across all platforms & devices.
        | Although I'm very familiar with using frameworks like: 
        span
          | React.js 
        | my websites are primarily hand-coded using: 
        span
          |HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript.
        | With a strong emphasis on "Progressive Enhancement", I look for creative ways to push the boundaries of website front-end code without compromising on browser support and performance.
